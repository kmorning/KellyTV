/**
 * Created by kmorning on 2018-02-10.
 *
 * This service pulls xmltv data from a web site URL contained in the incoming Intent (see
 * onHandleIntent()).  As it runs, it broadcasts it's status using LocalBroadcast Manger; any
 * component that wants to see the staus should implement a subclass of BroadcastReceiver and
 * register to receive broadcast Intents with category = CATEGORY_DEFAULT and action
 * Constants.BROADCAST_ACTION.
 *
 * Note:  maybe URL should come from a saved data file somewhere instead of passed through
 * Intent.
